This is a simple Caesar cipher encryption/ decryption file that creates your message in a .txt file.
To use this cipher download the caesar.exe file.
This .exe file requires two arguments; the cipher shift and the mode.
Example: to encrypt a message with a cipher shift of 13 you would enter in the CMD prompt the following:
  caesar.exe 13 E.
This will create the message.txt in the same location as the caesar.exe file.
To decrypt the message in the CMD prompt enter the following:
  caesar.exe 13 D.
You decrypted message will appear in the CMD prompt.

Notice that the cipher shift must be the same for you to read the message.

This is a fun way to send friends the message.txt file and if they also know the
Cipher shift they should be albe to read the message.\

Note: the .txt file must always be named: 'message.txt' because that is what the program
is looking for. 
New encrypted messages will override each other.
